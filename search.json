    "text": "Launch RStudio. It should detect your R installation automatically, but if not, a window will open asking you to select it. If R does not appear here, I suggest you restart your computer first.\nYou should be met by a scene that looks like this:\n\n\n\nA screenshot of a new RStudio installation on macOS.\n\n\nRstudio is designed around a four panel layout. Currently you can see three of them. To reveal the fourth, go to File -&gt; New file -&gt; R markdown... This will open an RMarkdown document, which is a form of coding “notebook”, where you can mix text, images and code in the same document. We will use these sorts of documents extensively in this course. Give your document a title like “BIOC13 Exercise Session 1”. You can put your name for author, and leave the rest as default for now. Click OK. Now your window should look something like this:\n\n\n\nA screenshot of RStudio on macOS with an RMarkdown file open, and the panels labelled.\n\n\n\nSource: This is where we edit code related documents. Anything you want to be able to save should be written here.\nConsole: the console is where R lives. This is where any command you write in the source pane and run will be sent to be executed.\nEnvironments: this panel shows you objects loaded into R. For example, if you were to assign a value to an object (e.g.x &lt;- 1), then it would appear here.\nOutput: this panel has many functions, but is commonly used to navigate files, show plots, show a rendered RMarkdown file or to read the R help documentation.\n\n\n\nRMarkdown is a file format for making dynamic documents with R. It combines plain text with embedded R code chunks that are run when the document is rendered, allowing you to include results and your R code directly in the document. This makes it a powerful tool for creating reproducible analyses, which are extremely important in science.\nThe RMarkdown document you opened has some example text and code. An RMarkdown document consists of three main parts:\n\nYAML Header: This section, enclosed by --- at the beginning and end, contains metadata about the document, such as the title, author, date, and output format.\nText: You can write plain text using Markdown syntax to format it. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax, which is easy to read and write.\nCode Chunks: These are sections of R code enclosed by triple backticks and {r}. You can click the green arrow to run all the code in a code chunk, or run each line of code using the Run button, or by using Ctrl+Enter (Windows) or Cmd+Enter (macOS)When the document is rendered, the code is executed, and the results are included in the output.\n\nNotice at the top left of the Source panel, there are two buttons: Source and Visual. These allow you to switch betwee two views of the RMarkdown document. The Source view is what you are looking at, and it is the raw text document. You can also use the Visual view, which allows you to work in a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) view, similar to Microsoft Office or other text editors. This “renders” your markdown code for you while you write. It also gives you a series of menus to help you format text, which means you do not need to learn how to write markdown code (although it is extremely simple, and you likely know some already).\nWhich ever view you prefer (and you can switch as often as you like), the code part stays the same. It is primarily there for editing the text around your code.\n\n\n\nBefore we go any further, we need to change some default settings in RStudio.\nGo to Tools -&gt; Global Settings, then:\n\nGo to the General tab.\n\nUn-tick “Restore .RData into workspace at startup”\nSet “Save workspace to RData on exit:” to Never.\n\nGo to the Code tab\n\nTick “Use native pipe operator, l&gt; (requires R 4.1+)”\n\nGo to the RMarkdown tab\n\nUn-tick “Show output inline for all R Markdown documents”\n\n\nWhile we are here, if you wanted to change the font size or theme, you can do that in the Appearance tab.\nRStudio also has screenreader support. You can enable that in the Accessibility tab.\n\n\n\nI strongly recommend you create a folder where you save all the work you do as part of this section of the course. I also recommend you make this folder in a part of your computer that is not being synced with a cloud service (iCloud, OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc). These services can cause issues with RStudio. You can always back up your work at the end of a session.\nWithin your new course folder, I also want you to make a new folder for each exercise we do. This will make it very easy for you to stay organsied and submit work you do to me for feedback. It also makes your code reproducible by simply sending someone the contents of the folder in question. For example, this is exercise 4, so my main folder might be called bioc13, and within that folder I might make a folder called exercise_1.\nWe now want to set our working directory to this bioc13/exercise_1 folder. A working directory is the directory (folder) in a file system where a user is currently working. It is the default location where all your R code will be executed and where files are read from or written to unless specified otherwise. To set the working directory using RStudio, go to Session -&gt; Set working directory -&gt; Choose directory, then navigate to the folder you just made for this exercise. You should do this at the start of each exercise.\nNotice that now in your Output pane, in the files tab, you can see the contents of your folder (which is probably nothing currently). Let’s change that.\n\n\n\nLet’s save this example RMarkdown document that RStudio has made for us. You do that exactly how you might expect. Go to File -&gt; Save, or use the floppy disc icon. Ensure you save it in your working directory with a descriptive name (e.g. exercise_1.Rmd). The file should have appeared in your Output pane, with the extension .Rmd.\nLet’s move onto working with some data!",

    "text": "Answering a research question\nOne of the questions that Nilsson et al. (2022) were interested in was if there has been any morphological divergence between the host races of these flies. In other words, do flies that use \"heterophyllum\" as a host_plant and flies that use \"oleraceum\" as a host_plant differ in some predictable way?\nLet’s use the variable ovipositor_length_mm to explore this research question.\n\nFiltering the dataset\nFirst, we should filter() our dataset to only contain females (as only females have an ovipositor). filter() is a function that let’s us write conditional statements that only allow rows that meet those conditions to “filter” through. For example, we can use filter() to only allow rows where sex == \"female\" to filter through, thereby creating a new dataset of just female flies.\nMake a new code cell, and write the following:\n\n1female_data &lt;-\n  tephritis_data |&gt; \n2  filter(sex == \"female\")\n\n\n1\n\nI assigned the new dataset to a new object, called female_data.\n\n2\n\nInside the filter() function, I can write any conditional statement.\n\n\n\n\nNow we have the rows we are interested in, let’s move on.\n\n\nExploratory plot\nOften before we start any formal statistics, we want to plot our data.\nR has a built in method to make plots, but here I will use a different approach. Instead we will use ggplot2, a plotting package that is installed with tidyverse. ggplot2 provides a clear and simple way to customise your plots. It is based in a data visualisation theory known as the grammer of graphics (gg) (Wilkinson 2013).\n\nThe grammer of graphics\nThe grammer of graphics gives us a way to describe any plot. ggplot2 then allows us to make that plot, using a layered approach to the grammer of graphics.\nUsing this approach, we can say a statistical graphic is a mapping of data variables to aesthetic attributes of geometric objects (Chester et al. 2025).\nWow. What does that mean? Let’s break it down.\nA ggplot2 plot has three essential components:\n\ndata: the dataset that contains the variables you want to plot\ngeom: the geometric object you want to use to display your data (e.g. a point, a line, a bar).\naes: aesthetic attributes that you want to map to your geometric object. For example, the x and y location of a point geometry could be mapped to two variables in your dataset, and the colour of those points could be mapped to a third.\n\nAs I said before, ggplot2 uses a layered approach to the grammer of graphics. This makes it very easy to start contructing plots by putting together a “recipe” step-by-step. Let’s walk through an example.\n\nIn our case, we want to plot ovipositor_length_mm for each host_plant group. One example might be a boxplot:\n\n\n\nA description of the data a boxplot shows\n\n\n\nggplot( \n1  data = female_data,\n2  mapping = aes(x = host_plant, y = ovipositor_length_mm)\n3  ) +\n4  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n1\n\nInside the ggplot() function, I specify the dataset as female_data\n\n2\n\nI map the host_plant column to the x axis aesthetic and the ovipositor_length_mm to the y axis aesthetic.\n\n3\n\nTo add layers to a ggplot() object, we can use a +\n\n4\n\nI add a boxplot geometry, that will use the aesthetics I specified before.\n\n\n\n\nCopy the code into a new code cell and run it\nRegarding our research question, what does the graph suggest to you?\n\n\n\nCalculating the observed statistic\nOur research question is:\n\nDo flies that use \"heterophyllum\" as a host_plant and flies that use \"oleraceum\" as a host_plant differ in their ovipositor_length_mm?\n\nThe question concerns a difference in a continuous variable between two groups (host_plant). Let’s start by exploring if there is a difference in the central tendancy of ovipositor_length_mm in the two groups. That is, does average ovipositor_length_mm differ between them?\nA suitable test statistic for this question could be a difference in means. Let’s start with that.\nWe are going to do that using the infer package we loaded at the start. infer is a statistics package that allows us to perform simulation based inferences without knowing a lot of computer code.\nTo use infer to calculate an observed statistic, we use the following approach:\n\nIn code, that looks like this:\n\n4obs_stat &lt;-\n1  female_data |&gt;\n2  specify(response = ovipositor_length_mm, explanatory = host_plant) |&gt;\n3  calculate(stat = \"diff in means\", order = c(\"heterophyllum\", \"oleraceum\"))\n\n\n1\n\nUsing the dataset we just made, we pipe |&gt; it into the next line.\n\n2\n\nWe specify() which columns we are interested in, and which is our response variable, and which is our explanatory variable. In this case, we want to explain ovipositor_length_mm using host_plant, and express that as a \"diff in means\".\n\n3\n\nWe calculate() our chosen statisitc \"diff in means\", and we say that the subtraction should be \"heterophyllum\" minus \"oleraceum\".\n\n4\n\nWe assign this to a new object called obs_stat.\n\n\n\n\nUse the code above in a new code cell to calculate the observed statistic.\nTo see your observed statistic, simply print it by writing the name of the object:\n\nobs_stat\n\nDescribe what this observed statistic tells us.\n\n\nQuantifying uncertainty\nIf we took another sample, it is unlikely that we would get exactly the same observed statistic. We want to quantify that effect. In this exercise, we will use a 95% confidence interval.\n\n\n\nA general approach to bootstrapping confidence intervals\n\n\nWe have already calculated our observed statistic, so let’s generate a sampling distribution using bootstrapping.\nTo do that in code, we write the following:\n\n2boot_dist &lt;-\n  female_data |&gt; \n  specify(response = ovipositor_length_mm, explanatory = host_plant) |&gt;\n1  generate(reps = 10000, type = \"bootstrap\") |&gt;\n  calculate(stat = \"diff in means\", order = c(\"heterophyllum\", \"oleraceum\"))\n\n\n1\n\nNotice how this is almost identical to the code we used to get the observed statistic, but we have one extra step, where we generate 10000 bootstrapped datasets, then calculate the diff in means for all of them.\n\n2\n\nWe assign this to a new object, called boot_dist\n\n\n\n\nUse the code above in a new code cell to get a bootstrap sampling distribution\nAgain we can print it by just writing its name:\n\nboot_dist\n\ninfer has a helpful function to quickly see the distribution:\n\nvisualize(boot_dist)\n\n\nConfidence intervals\nWe can use the percentile method to calculate a confidence interval. To do that we take the middle 95% of the bootstrapped sampling distribution. Again, infer has a helpful function to do this for us:\n\nconf_int &lt;-\n  get_confidence_interval(boot_dist, level = 0.95, type = \"percentile\")\n\nUse the code above to calculate your confidence interval\nAgain, print the object to see the confidence intervals:\n\nconf_int\n\nWe can also visualise the confidence interval on our sampling distribution:\n\nvisualize(boot_dist) +\n  shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = conf_int)\n\nWrite a statement using your observed statistic and confidence intervals. How would you explain what a confidence interval is to someone who hasn’t studied statistics?\n\n\n\nHypothesis testing\nWhile our confidence interval gives us a pretty big clue, we can also formally test if flies that use \"heterophyllum\" as a host_plant and flies that use \"oleraceum\" as a host_plant differ in their ovipositor_length_mm?\n\n\n\n\n\nTo do that we need to construct a null and alternative hypothesis.\nNull hypothesis:\n\nPosits that the explanatory variable we test does NOT affect our data\nWe test the null hypothesis: sufficient evidence to reject it?\n\nAlternative hypothesis:\n\nOpposite of the Null hypothesis (the explanatory variable affects our data)\nWe normally think in terms of an alternative hypothesis\n\nState the null and alternative hypotheses in your document in text.\n\nGenerating data assuming the null hypothesis is true\nAs we did in the lecture, we will use a shuffling or permute method of creating a sampling distribution compatible with our null hypothesis.\nTo do that with infer, the code looks like this:\n\n3null_dist &lt;-\n  female_data |&gt; \n  specify(response = ovipositor_length_mm, explanatory = host_plant) |&gt;\n1  hypothesise(null = \"independence\") |&gt;\n2  generate(reps = 10000, type = \"permute\") |&gt;\n  calculate(stat = \"diff in means\", order = c(\"heterophyllum\", \"oleraceum\"))\n\n\n1\n\nAgain, the code looks very similar, but now we have added an extra hypothesise() step, where we declare our null hypothesis to be that the response and explanatory variables are independent of each other.\n\n2\n\nWe generate 10000 permutated datasets under this hypothesis, and calculate the statistic for each dataset\n\n3\n\nSave as an object called null_dist\n\n\n\n\nUse the code above in a new code cell to get a null distribution.\nYou can print by writing the name:\n\nnull_dist\n\nThe same command as we used before for the bootstrap sampling distribution can be used to visualise your null distribution. Use visualise() to show your null distribution.\nYou can also show your observed statistic on this distribution in a similar way to the confidence intervals. Try adapting the following code to show your observed statistic on the graph:\n\nshade_p_value(obs_stat)\n\nIf you are stuck, look at how the shade_confidence_interval() function is used.\nFinally, let’s calculate the p-value. We will do a so-called “two-sided” test, which means we want to know if there is a difference in any direction:\n\nget_p_value(null_dist, obs_stat, direction = \"two-sided\")\n\nWhat is your conclusion?\nWhen you get to this stage, let me know and we will discuss your finding!",

For biologists, it offers an invaluable toolkit to analyse experimental results, manage large datasets (e.g., genomic or ecological data), and create publication-quality graphs. Unlike point-and-click software, R allows you to automate repetitive tasks, ensuring efficiency and reproducibility in your research. Its flexibility and extensive capabilities make it a staple in almost all fields within biology, both in academia and in industries. A huge reason for this is that R is free to use, and as such has a global community continually developing new tools and resources tailored to scientific research.\n\n\nR can be used in a number of ways.

    "section": "Programming concepts",
    "text": "Programming concepts\nWhile it is not required to be an experienced computer programmer to use R, there is still a set of basic programming concepts that new R users need to understand. We will cover these first. You do not need to memorise these things.\n\nObjects\nIn R, data can be stored in objects. An object can be thought of as a container that holds data. You can create an object by assigning a value to a name using the assignment operator &lt;-. In the example below, I assign the value 5 to the object x, and the value 10 to the object y. We can then perform maths or other operations using these objects. Calculate the sum of x and y using + on the line below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx &lt;- 5\ny &lt;- 10\nx + y\n\n\n\n\nAdd a third object called z and assign it the value 12. Write a math equation that will output the value 24, using x, y, and z only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx &lt;- 5\ny &lt;- 10\nz &lt;- 12\n\ny / x * z\n\n\n\n\nObjects can hold any sort of data in R. It could be a single value like in the above example, multiple values, text, a whole dataset, or a plot.\n\n\nData types\nIn R, data can come in various types, and it’s important to understand these types to manipulate and analyse data effectively. Here are some of the most common data types in R:\n\nNumeric: Represents numbers and can be either integers or floating-point numbers. For example, 42 and 3.14 are numeric values.\nCharacter: Represents text or string data. Character values are enclosed in quotes, such as \"Hello, world!\".\nLogical: Represents boolean values, which can be either TRUE or FALSE.\nFactor: Used to represent categorical data. Factors are useful for storing data that has a fixed number of unique values, such as “Species A” and “Species B” for species ID.\n\n\n\nVectors\nVectors are one of the most basic data structures in R. A vector is a sequence of data elements of the same basic type. We will sometimes directly use vectors in this course, so it will be good to be familiar with them.\n\nCreating Vectors: You can create a vector using the c() function, which stands for “combine” or “concatenate”. For example, here I create 3 vectors, and assign them to different objects:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing Elements: You can access elements (position) of a vector using square brackets []. For example, to access the second element of character_vector:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that in R, the first position is [1], not [0] like in some programming languages.\nVector Operations: You can perform operations on vectors. These operations are applied element-wise. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that every value in the vector gets multiplied and returned.\nVector Length: You can find the length (number of values in it) of a vector using the length() function:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataframes\nDataframes are like spreadsheets. They have rows and columns, and all columns are the same length. These are the primary way we will represent data in this course.\n\n\n\nspecies\nmass_g\nsex\n\n\n\n\nblue_tit\n9.1\nmale\n\n\nblue_tit\n10.6\nmale\n\n\nsparrow\n27.3\nfemale\n\n\n\nWe will come back to them soon.\n\n\nBoolean and logical operators\nBoolean operators are used to perform logical operations and return boolean values (TRUE or FALSE). We will use them in this course to describe our hypotheses. Here are the most common boolean operators in R:\n\nComparison Operators: These operators compare two values and return a boolean value.\n\n== : Equal to\n!= : Not equal to\n&lt; : Less than\n&gt; : Greater than\n&lt;= : Less than or equal to\n&gt;= : Greater than or equal to\n\n\nFor example, this bit of code should evaluate to TRUE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this should be FALSE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the operators above to fill in the blanks below such that the code will evaluate to TRUE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100 == 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np &lt;- 48\n\n8 + p == 56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nq &lt;- 24\nr &lt;- 88\n\n1q + 65 &gt; r\n\n1\n\nAny number &gt; 64 will work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now add in some logical operators:\n\nLogical Operators: These operators are used to combine multiple boolean expressions.\n\n& : Logical AND\n| : Logical OR\n! : Logical NOT\n\n\nFor example, this bit of code should evaluate to TRUE, because both the first part 1 + 3 == 4 and the second part 5 &gt;= 4 is TRUE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhereas this evaluates to FALSE, because only the first part is TRUE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if we change the & to an OR operator |, it evaluates to TRUE because at least one part of it is TRUE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the operators above to fill in the blanks below such that the code will evaluate to TRUE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfruit_a &lt;- \"apple\"\nfruit_b &lt;- \"banana\"\n\n1(fruit_a != fruit_b) & (1.5 &gt; 1.2)\n\n1\n\nOR | would also work here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfruit_a &lt;- \"apple\"\nfruit_b &lt;- \"banana\"\n\n(fruit_a == fruit_a) | (35 + 12 &gt; 47)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctions\nFunctions perform tasks in R. Functions can take inputs, called arguments, and return outputs. We put the arguments inside the brackets. For example, in R there is a function called mean(). This function’s first argument x should be a vector of numeric data. The function then outputs the mean as a single numeric value. For example, here we assign a vector of tree heights (cm) to an object called trees. We then calculate the mean tree height using the mean() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that if we are going to supply arguments in the order that the function expects them, we do not have to tell the function which object is for each argument. Since mean() expects the first argument to be the vector you want the mean of, we can also write:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find out what a function can do, and its arguments, use can write ?function_name, and the R helpfile will be returned for that function (e.g., ?mean). These helpfiles can be confusing at first, but the more you use R, the more they will make sense.\nWe will work with functions a lot in this course, so don’t worry if it still seems confusing.\n\n\nPipes\nOne of the final concepts I will introduce is the pipe operator |&gt;. Note that you will often see it written as %&gt;% when searching online. This is for historical reasons (R by default did not have a pipe operator until recently, so people had made their own). |&gt; comes with R by default now, while %&gt;% requires you to load a package called magrittr first (we will cover packages soon).\nPipes allow you to write code in a way that often makes more sense to people, especially non-programmers. To explain, here’s an example. Note that this is not real code, so you cannot run it.\nSay I wanted to run 3 different functions on a dataframe called my_data. The functions are function_1(), function_2(), and function_3(). Imagine function_1() first transforms my data into the right scale, function_2() then performs a statistical test, and function_3() then makes a plot (again, these are not real functions, just for the example).\nI could write that in a few ways. The first way would look like this:\n\n1my_data_1 &lt;- function_1(my_data)\n2my_data_2 &lt;- function_2(my_data_1)\n3my_data_final &lt;- function_3(my_data_2)\n\n\n1\n\nThe original data, my_data, is passed to function_1(), and the result is stored in my_data_1.\n\n2\n\nThe transformed data, my_data_1, is then passed to function_2(), and the result is stored in my_data_2.\n\n3\n\nFinally, the data from my_data_2 is passed to function_3(), and the result is stored in my_data_final.\n\n\n\n\nWhile this method is quite clear to read, it creates a lot of objects that we might not want to do anything with. This is not a huge issue, but could become one if you are working with very large data sets.\nWe could also write it like this:\n\nmy_data_final &lt;- function_3(function_2(function_1(my_data)))\n\nWe can wrap functions within functions to put this whole operation on one line. This gets rid of those extra objects, having only a my_data_final as the output. However, the order in which the functions are written no longer matches the order in which they are run. In the above example, function_1() runs first, then function_2(), then function_3(). But they are written in reverse order when we read it left to right.\nA final method of writing this makes use of pipes |&gt;, and has the best of both approaches:\n\nmy_data_final &lt;- my_data |&gt; function_1() |&gt; function_2() |&gt; function_3()\n\nPipes also allow us to spread our code over multiple lines, and the |&gt; will look for the next bit of code on the next line if nothing comes after it:\n\nmy_data_final &lt;- \n  my_data |&gt; \n  function_1() |&gt; \n  function_2() |&gt; \n  function_3()\n\nAll the above examples have the same my_data_final output, but are just written in different ways. The computer reads them all identically, so the main benefit is how readable your code is.\nIn this course, we will use pipes extensively, along with a set of packages that are designed for this kind of workflow. Below, rewrite the examples to use pipes. You can check the solutions tab to see if you are on the right track:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1trees |&gt; mean()\n\n1\n\nTake the trees vector, and then pipe|&gt; it into the mean() function.\n\n\n\nThe log() function performs a natural logarithm transformation of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1trees |&gt;\n  log() |&gt;\n  mean() \n\n1\n\nTake the trees vector, and then pipe|&gt; it into the log() function, then into the mean() function.\n\n\n\n\n\nPackages\nAn R package is a set of functions, data and/or information that someone else has written, that you can first load, then use in your own R code. Packages are written by other R users, and distributed for free via repositories, like The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).\nR packages are often used to save you time. While all the functions in an R package are written with R, and you could write them again yourself, why bother? If someone else has done it already and shared it, fantastic! In this course, we are going to use two package “families”. They are tidyverse and tidymodels. Note that both start with tidy. Remember from the lecture, that tidy refers to a particular format of data, and these packages all assume your data will be in the format, and will always return data in that format. They are also all built with pipes in mind, and are designed to make complex programming tasks (especially those performed by data scientists, of which biology fits in well) very easy. We will cover these packages in detail soon, but know to use them you need to do two things:\n\nInstall the package. This needs to be done once on your computer, using the install.packages() command. For examples:\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n\nThis will install ggplot2, a package for plotting data. It will install it from CRAN by default, and probably (assuming you are in Sweden) will be downloaded from a server in Umeå.\n\nWe now need to load the package, so that we can access it while we write code. To do that, we use the library() function.\n\n\n1library(ggplot2)\n\n\n1\n\nNote that we no longer require the \" around the package name. But the function would still work if you did include them.\n\n\n\n\nBelow I have written some code that makes a plot using an inbuilt R dataset called iris using the package ggplot2. But if you try to run it, you will get an error. The ggplot2 package has already been installed, so fix the code by loading the ggplot2 package before the code that makes the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1library(ggplot2)\niris |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, colour = Species)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n1\n\nMake sure to load the ggplot2 package before the ggplot() function. Code is always executed top to bottom.\n\n\n\nThat was a lot of concepts in a very short amount of time! Take a well deserved break before the next exercise.",

This should work for everything we do in the class, but if you accidentally refresh your page or close your browser without saving your work locally, it will be lost.\nYou use Posit Cloud. The free tier should be enough for everything we do here. The downside is you need an internet connection to use it.\nUsing Google Colab. The free tier should again be enough for everything in this class, however the interface is going to be very different.\n\n\n\nInstalling R locally (via a linux container)\nI suggest you follow this guide carefully (it will take some time). Ask the teacher if you are stuck.\n\n\nUsing webR IDE\nThis is a “proof-of-concept” tool, and is not actually intended to be used for real data analysis. However, it is very functional, and we can use it for almost everything in this class. The place where things will be different is when it comes to making Rmarkdown files. This is not supported, but you can still write R scripts with comments, which is fine. You can find it here. However, I would really suggest just using a borrowed laptop over this option.\n\n\nUsing Posit Cloud\nPosit are the company that make RStudio, and they offer a version of it online that works almost identically to the desktop version. All your computations are performed on Posit servers, and with the free plan, you are limited with how much compute time you can use per month. However, the default should be enough for this course. However, I would really suggest just using a borrowed laptop over this option. If you want to use it, you can find it here.\n\n\nGoogle Colab\nColab uses Jupyter to run R code. It is a bit different to the RStudio interface. I personally find that Colab can be very frustrating if you are not a paying user, as you often have to “queue” for a CPU for your code to run on. If you really want to use this (if you are familiar with python/jupyter it might be very intuative), here is a guide to setup R with Colab, and here is a link to Colab itself. However, I would really suggest just using a borrowed laptop over this option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niPadOS\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no way to run R natively on your device.
