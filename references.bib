  abstract = {Before writing the graphics for SYSTAT in the 1980's, I began by teaching a seminar in statistical graphics and collecting as many different quantitative graphics as I could find. I was determined to produce a package that could draw every statistical graphic I had ever seen. The structure of the program was a collection of procedures named after the basic graph types they p- duced. The graphics code was roughly one and a half megabytes in size. In the early 1990's, I redesigned the SYSTAT graphics package using - ject-based technology. I intended to produce a more comprehensive and - namic package. I accomplished this by embedding graphical elements in a tree structure. Rendering graphics was done by walking the tree and editing worked by adding and deleting nodes. The code size fell to under a megabyte. In the late 1990's, I collaborated with Dan Rope at the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Dan Carr at George Mason University to produce a graphics p- duction library called GPL, this time in Java. Our goal was to develop graphics components. This book was nourished by that project. So far, the GPL code size is under half a megabyte.},

  abstract = {Adaptation to new ecological niches is known to spur population  diversification and may lead to speciation if gene flow is ceased. While  adaptation to the same ecological niche is expected to be parallel, it is  more difficult to predict whether selection against maladaptive  hybridization in secondary sympatry results in parallel divergence also in  traits that are not directly related to the ecological niches. Such  parallelisms in response to selection for reproductive isolation can be  identified through estimating parallelism in reproductive character  displacement across different zones of secondary contact. Here, we use a  host shift in the phytophagous peacock fly Tephritis conura, with both  host races represented in two geographically separate areas East and West  of the Baltic Sea to investigate convergence in morphological adaptations.  We asked i) if there are consistent morphological adaptations to a host  plant shift and ii) if the response to secondary sympatry with the  alternate host race is parallel across contact zones. We found  surprisingly low and variable, albeit significant, divergence between host  races. Only one trait, the length of the female ovipositor, which serves  an important function in the interaction with the hosts, was consistently  different between host races. Instead, co-existence with the other host  race significantly affected the degree of morphological divergence, but  the divergence was largely driven by different traits in different contact  zones. Thus, local stochastic fixation or reinforcement could generate  trait divergence, and additional evidence is needed to conclude whether  divergence is locally adaptive.},

  abstract = {Understanding the evolution of evolvability—the evolutionary potential of populations—is key to predicting adaptation to novel environments. Despite growing evidence that evolvability structures adaptation, it remains unclear how adaptation to novel environments in turn influences evolvability. Here we address the interplay between adaptation and evolvability in the peacock fly Tephritis conura, which recently underwent an adaptive change in ovipositor length following a host shift. We compared the evolvability of morphological traits, including ovipositor length, between the ancestral and the derived host race. We found that mean evolvability was reduced in females of the derived host race compared to the ancestral host race. However, patterns of multivariate evolvability (considering trait covariances) were very similar in both host races, and populations of the derived host race had diverged from the ancestral host race in directions of greater-than-average evolvability. Exploration of phenotypic integration patterns further revealed relatively high levels of independent variation in ovipositor length compared to other measured traits, allowing some degree of independent divergence. Our findings suggest that adaptation to novel environments can reduce mean evolvability without major changes in patterns of variational constraints, and that trait autonomy helps facilitate divergence of functionally important traits.},

(Standard jackknife theory gives an approximate mean and variance in the case R(X, F) = θ(F̂) - θ(F), θ some parameter of interest.) A general method, called the "bootstrap," is introduced, and shown to work satisfactorily on a variety of estimation problems. The jackknife is shown to be a linear approximation method for the bootstrap. The exposition proceeds by a series of examples: variance of the sample median, error rates in a linear discriminant analysis, ratio estimation, estimating regression parameters, etc.},
